  In realms where light does softly tread,
  A gentle glow where we are led.
  Sunbeams dance with joy so free,
  In a world of warmth, we find our glee.
  Fields of gold under the azure sky,
  In the light, our spirits ever high.
  A canvas painted in hues so bright,
  We find our peace in this splendid light.

  In the quietude of the shadowâ€™s grace,
  Mysteries cloak the silent space.
  Moonlight whispers to the tranquil sea,
  In the dark, our souls dare to be.
  Stars twinkle in the velvet night,
  Guiding us with their gentle light.
  A universe veiled in enigmatic art,
  We explore the depths of our own heart.
